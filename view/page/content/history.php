    Begining of the Kopi Luwak is closely related to the history of coffee cultivation in Indonesia. At the beginning of the 18th century, 
    the Dutch opened the commercial plantation colonies in the East Indies, 
    especially in Java and Sumatra. One is the Arabica coffee seedlings imported from Yemen. In the era of "cultivation" or Cultuurstelsel (1830-1870), 
    Dutch ban indigenous farm workers picking coffee berries for personal consumption, but locals want to try the famous coffee drinks. Then plantation workers eventually find that there is a kind of weasel who likes to eat the coffee fruit, but only the undigested flesh, and seeds of the coffee husk still intact and undigested. 
    Coffee beans in civet droppings are then take, washed, roasted, ground, and brewed with hot water, it creates a Luwak coffee. [1] The news about the pleasures of aromatic coffee is finally wafted by Dutch citizens planter, then the coffee is a hobby people wealthy Dutch. Because of its rarity and unusual manufacturing process, 
    civet coffee is coffee that was expensive since colonial times.
